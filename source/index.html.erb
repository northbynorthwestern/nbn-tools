		<h1>Best practices for working with NBNteractive</h1>
		<p><b>First,</b> brainstorm what you envision for your project. What kind of story are you trying to tell and how can interactive elements communicate it? Approach the Interactive editors with some ideas. As the writer or editor, you understand the story best. If you aren't sure how to translate your story to the web, pick out key elements you wish to highlight (i.e. photos, nonlinear narrative, data analysis and explanation) and discuss it with the Interactive editors.</p>
		<br />
		<p><b>Second,</b> make sure you aren't adding interactivity just for interactivity's sake. It's great to want to do something with parallax scrolling (because sometimes it looks really cool), but remember that every visual or interactive design choice should serve a purpose that helps the reader in some way. Although it's important to know the types of tools and technologies available for you, it's equally important to lead with ideas.</p>
		<br />
		<p><b>Third,</b> work closely with the interactive team throughout the reporting process. Traditionally, the interactive section has been a service desk where people hand off finished stories and ask "make this interactive." Though this may apply for some stories (especially if they're time sensitive), there's less interesting things that can be done with an almost-finished product. It's like making brownies - if you thrust a freshly-baked batch at someone and ask them to make mint chocolate chip brownies, they might be able to put some on the top, but it won't taste half as good as it would've been if you'd added the mint chocolate chips before they went in the oven. Work with the Interactive section even when it's just a half-baked idea: we'll make it delicious.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Allow at least 2 weeks for the Interactive team to work on your project.</p>
